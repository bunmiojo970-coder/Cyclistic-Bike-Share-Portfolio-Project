Overall, there are approximately two times more annual members than casual riders from 2020 to 2025\n2. Overall, electric bikes had the most frequency of use for both annual members and casual riders from 2020 to 2025.\n3. Overall, saturday and sunday had the highest frequency of use and average ride length respectively for all casual riders from 2020 to 2025.\n4. Overall, sunday also had the highest average ride length while thursday had the highest frequency of use for all annual members from 2020 to 2025.\n5. Overall, the classic bikes had the highest average ride length for all annual members 2020 to 2025.\n6. Overall, the docked bikes had the highest average ride length for all casual riders from 2020 to 2025.\n   \n\n    \n### **Recommendations**\n\n1. Restrict access to electric bikes to only annual members on Sunday and Saturdays since these are the days with the highest average ride length covered and highest frequency of use respectively by the casual riders.This will make many of the casual riders consider subscribing to become annual members to get access to their preferred orders leading to more profit for the company.\n2. Another approach would be to send all casual riders a weekly email notification about a very good discount only on saturdays and sundays (e.g 10%) on the pricing plan to convert their subscription to annual membership.
